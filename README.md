Draw a 3D scene using the specified freeglut library

## 1. Description
I drew a three-dimensional amusement park with the sky, the grass, a Ferris wheel,
a carousel, an enclosing wall, a road and some cars by using some relevant OpenGL libraries in freeglut.
The sky, the grass, the carousel, the road and the enclosing wall were mapped with some pictures in bmp
format by using texture mapping technology. In addition, an ambient lighting model also be implemented
in this scene.<br>

The Ferris wheel, the carousel and the cars all have animation effects. The Ferris wheel and the carousel
are working and the keyboard can control their running speed and directions. The speed and directions
of cars running on the road can also be switched by the keyboard. The colored lights on the Ferris wheel
keep flashing with different colors which can also be stopped. The sky can switch between day and dusk
with a different light intensity by mouse interaction. Moreover, the three-dimensional scene can change
the perspective through the keyboard.<br>
